### Brief overview in the accents in the Tanach

- There are **two** main systems of accents: one system for the majority of the books, known as the "Twenty-One Books" (Prose) and another system for the remaining books, known as "Three Books" (Poetry)

  - `Prose` ( Hebrew: סגנון פרוזאי ): This style is used for narrative and descriptive passages, such as historical accounts, genealogies, and instructional texts. Prose is characterized by a straightforward and simple writing style, with a focus on conveying information and telling a story.

  - `Poetry` ( Hebrew: סגנון שירי ): This style is used for expressive and lyrical passages, such as psalms, songs, and wisdom literature. Poetry is characterized by a more formal and structured writing style, with a focus on rhythm, meter, and figurative language.
  
  These two styles are not mutually exclusive, and many passages in the Tanach blend elements of both prose and poetry. However, in general, the Tanach can be divided into sections that are primarily prose (such as the historical books of Genesis, Exodus, and Numbers) and sections that are primarily poetry (such as the book of Psalms and the book of Job).

  It's worth noting that the distinction between prose and poetry in the Tanach is not always clear-cut, and different scholars and traditions may have different opinions on the matter. Additionally, the writing styles in the Tanach have evolved over time, and different books and sections may reflect different literary and cultural influences.

- Accents have three roles at the same time:
  
  - To indicate of stressed syllables, but not always.
  - To indicate the syntactic relation in a sentence.
  - Intonation of the words, used for singing the sentence.

- Within each system there are two major categories of Masoretic accents:

  - Disjunctive accents
  - Conjunctive accents

- The same (UTF-8) accent can be disjunctive in the "Twenty-One Books" and conjunctive in the "Three Books".

- It is possible that one Unicode code-point can be mapped to different Hebrew accents.
